                <p>The first trailer for the much-anticipated and strike-delayed “Deadpool and Wolverine” movie starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman was viewed by 365 million people in the first 24 hours it was available, Variety first reported Tuesday, smashing the record to become the most-viewed trailer in one day of all time. The “Deadpool and Wolverine” trailer premiered during the Super Bowl and was promoted by its stars in the aftermath, including an Instagram post from Reynolds that saw the star posing next to the trailer paused on a TV with the caption, “Has everyone seen the #Deadpool trailer? Also has anyone seen my wife?”—a joke about Blake Lively’s much-publicized trip to the big game with friend Taylor Swift.</p>

The accolade isn't a new one for Marvel—with Deadpool in the top spot, six of the top-10 most viewed trailers in the first 24 hours belong to movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, according to IMDB.

                <p>"Deadpool 3" was officially announced in September of 2022 and was expected to be released two years later, but it was pushed back to November of 2024, then May of 2025 and is now finally confirmed to be releasing July 26, 2024. The film will see Deadpool offered a spot in the legendary Avengers lineup and features a tie-in with the Time Variance Authority from the Disney show "Loki." The film is the only movie in Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe to be released next year after the studio's release schedule was turned upside down by last year's actors and writers strikes. As of now, only 5 superhero movies will be released this year: "Madame Web" will hit theaters Wednesday, followed by two more Sony productions in "Kraven the Hunter" and "Venom 3." DC will also release "Joker: Folie à Deux" in October. After “Deadpool,” the next release in Disney’s Avengers-based Marvel world will be "Captain America: Brave New World," slated for a Valentine's Day release in 2025.</p>

                <p>“Deadpool and Wolverine” hits theaters on July 26 and marks the introduction of Ryan Reynolds‘ R-rated Merc With a Mouth into Disney’s family-friendly Marvel Cinematic Universe. Deadpool, who previously starred in two standalone Fox movies, made fun of Disney in the first bloody, fourth-wall-breaking trailer. Dubbing himself “Marvel Jesus,” Deadpool arrives in the MCU after being kidnapped by the Time Variance Authority, the multiverse managers last seen in “Loki,” and finds himself in the same world as the Avengers.</p>
